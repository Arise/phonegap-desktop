#Phonegap desktop
The aim of this project is to allow developers to use PhoneGap in a desktop browser.

Have a look at the [online demo](http://jxp.github.com/phonegap-desktop/demo/) (Best viewed in Chrome)
This is a copy of the phonegap [kitchen sink demo](https://github.com/mwbrooks/phonegap-kitchen-sink) using my desktop library.


All PhoneGap API calls are simulated and the data returned is determined by json files.

See the Wiki for some notes on getting started.


Current Status:

Merged changes from flocsy and diegolamonica  
Added warning message if JSON data cannot be loaded  
Added section headings and links to API docs  
Firefox keyboard issue was caused by My Homepage extension  


Next Steps:

Add Cordova File API methods  
Look at using new getUserMedia method for camera capture (latest release of Chrome, Opera beta)  
Investigate overriding Firefox geolocation
