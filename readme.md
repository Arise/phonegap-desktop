#Phonegap desktop
The aim of this project is to allow developers to use PhoneGap in a desktop browser.

Have a look at the [online demo](http://jxp.github.com/phonegap-desktop/demo/) (Best viewed in Chrome)
This is a copy of the phonegap [kitchen sink demo](https://github.com/mwbrooks/phonegap-kitchen-sink) using my desktop library.


All PhoneGap API calls are simulated and the data returned is determined by json files.

See the Wiki for some notes on getting started.


Current Status:

Implemented code for all API methods  
Tested in IE, Firefox and Chrome  
Created wiki pages for the library 


Next Steps:

Look at using new getUserMedia method for camera capture (latest release of Chrome)  
Add Cordova File API methods  
Investigate other keyboard shortcuts (current ones don't work in Firefox)  
Investigate overriding Firefox geolocation
