The aim of this project is to allow developers to use PhoneGap in a desktop browser.

All PhoneGap API calls will be simulated and the data returned is determined by json files.


Current Status:

Implemented basic structure
Stubbed most API calls
Implemented camera.getPicture (only with Url option)
Implemented example plugin (barcodescanner)
Tested in IE, Firefox and Chrome


Next Steps:

Stub remaining API calls
Provide documentation on how to use
Start implementing each API call (and test desktop brwosers against Android implementation)
