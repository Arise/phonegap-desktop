#Phonegap desktop
The aim of this project is to allow developers to use PhoneGap in a desktop browser.

Have a look at the [online demo](http://jxp.github.com/phonegap-desktop/demo/) (Best viewed in Chrome)
This is a copy of the phonegap [kitchen sink demo](https://github.com/mwbrooks/phonegap-kitchen-sink) from using my desktop library.


All PhoneGap API calls are simulated and the data returned is determined by json files.

See the Wiki for some notes on getting started.


Current Status:

Implemented code for all API methods
Tested in IE, Firefox and Chrome


Next Steps:

Provide documentation on how to use
Complete full testing
Investigate overriding Firefox geolocation
Look at possibility of using new getUserMedia method
